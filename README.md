# Javascript-from-Zero 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning **JavaScript from scratch** through **structured problem solving**.  
I focus on understanding core concepts, building logic, and writing clean, readable code.

This foundation will later support advanced topics such as **automation testing, frameworks, and real-world projects**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn JavaScript from absolute beginner level
- Build strong programming and logical thinking skills
- Practice problem solving for each concept
- Write simple, clean, and understandable JavaScript code
- Create a solid base for automation testing and advanced tools

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Topic-wise learning
- Small problems → gradual complexity
- Hands-on coding instead of memorization
- Regular GitHub commits to track progress

Each folder contains **concept practice + problem-solving files**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- JavaScript Basics
- Variables & Data Types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Strings
- Objects
- Logical & Problem-Solving Exercises

More topics will be added as learning progresses.
